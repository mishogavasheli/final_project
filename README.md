## **Overview**
###### This project is about food recipe recommendations. I took a dataset from food.com where were more than 200 000 recipes and more than one million reviews and ratings and built the function for the recommendation. According to users wishes, the recommender shows you the best matches by ratings and review sentiments. 

## **About dataset**
###### 

## **Data exploration and preparation** 
###### I explored this dataset with python, tableau, and excel. After this, I decided to remove some nulls and dropped unneeded columns. Also, I removed double spaces from columns. Then I started preparing data for the function. I add columns for vegetarian food, for low calories (under 200 calories),  for difficulty, for a quick recipe (under 30 min), for food type and cuisine.

## **Function-recommender** 
###### The principle of this recommendation is filtering recipes step by step with user interaction. Users need to answer a couple of questions about food preferences, then the function will show the top 5 matching recipes by ratings and review sentiments. Then you need to choose one of them and it will shows you recipe name, ingredients, steps and time to cook
